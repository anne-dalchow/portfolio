    <p>
      Hey there, I'm Anne! <br />
      I found my passion for coding through design. <br />
      I love turning ideas into real, working things. Learning to code is a never-ending
      journey, and what keeps me going is the sense of progress I feel after every little
      breakthrough and the excitement of turning challenges into solutions.

        <p>
          I'm always curious to learn new technologies and enjoy the challenge of figuring
          things out. Learning and growing is what drives me.

          I approach problems with creativity and persistence. I love bouncing ideas off others
          — it's one of the best ways to grow.
