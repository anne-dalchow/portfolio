        Hey there, I'm Anne! <br />
        I found my passion for coding through design. <br />
        I love turning ideas into real, working things. Learning to code is a never-ending
        journey, and what keeps me going is the sense of progress I feel after every little
        breakthrough and the excitement of turning challenges into solutions.

          <p>I'm based in Leipzig, Germany, and open to working both locally and remotely.</p>

          <p>
            I'm always curious to learn new technologies and enjoy the challenge of figuring
            things out. Learning and growing is what drives me.

            I approach problems with creativity and persistence. I love bouncing ideas off others
            — it's one of the best ways to grow.
